		<p>This year, I started taking lessons for ping-pong thanks to the university sport course <a href="https://www.univ-tours.fr/campus/accueil-sport-1/accueil-sport">SUAPS</a>. I already knew how to play because at my house i have a ping-pong table and a family to play with but i wasn't that good. Since i started this course every monday, my level has increased with new techniques and better movements.

		<p>Here we can see me in front of two screens making the website YOU are reading, it was a great time to learn how to manipulate markup languages like HTML and CSS and use the knowledge i acheived during class into something. Before the university course i am doing this year (R&T), i learned to use a couple of editing software like adobe premiere pro and photoshop in my personal time thanks to videos on youtube which inspired me a lot. During the summer holidays, i learned the basics of HTML to be prepared for my fisrt year as an IT student. Also, I sometimes spend my time on video games to take a break.
